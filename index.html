            My name is Kanyisa Ntombini. I am training to be an Agile Web Developer with skills in 
            HTML/CSS and JavaScript. I am also partially-sighted due to a condition called Keratoconus
             and as a result, I am a disability activist. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Initially, I wanted to pursue a career in science and technology because I thought it was
             so cool. However, as I grew up with technology such as screen readers and ZoomText enabled
              me to access phones, computers and be able to study. As a result, I would like to develop
               accessible technology as well at an affordable price so that disabled people from low 
               income communities can access it as well.
        </p>  
        <p>
            When I am not coding or doing activism I love hiking, going to the beach and spending time 
            with my friends and family. I am also an avid knitter!
